# Introduction {.unnumbered}

This is a collection of tutorials on how to handle spatial data in R. The tutorials target students and scientists in ecology with previous knowledge of the [R software](https://cran.r-project.org/).

The core tutorial was developed for a two half-day workshop, but you can follow the tutorials at your own pace.


:::{.callout-tip title="The ecologist mind"}
In these tutorials, we characterize the habitat of otter that were observed in 2021 around Montpellier, France. This small toy case study is not relevant ecologically but provides a good opportunity to tackle multiple challenges with handling and collecting spatial data. 
:::


### R packages

The tutorials rely mostly on [`terra` R-package](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/index.html) as it was specifically developed to tackle all challenges faced by ecologists, agronomists or biologists when using spatial data.  
R has an exceptional diversity of users and packages, and this is especially true with the dynamic community around spatial data. Another popular package for handling spatial data is `sf` (and `stars`).   


### Workshop program

**Half day 1: Vectors**  

- [Introduction to GIS](https://frbcesab.github.io/spatial-r/chapters/02_presentation_gis.html): differences between vectors and rasters, short overview of coordinate reference system (CRS)
- [Points](https://frbcesab.github.io/spatial-r/chapters/11_points.html): Understand otter field observations as spatial points
- [Lines](https://frbcesab.github.io/spatial-r/chapters/12_lines.html): Add infomation about river networks    
- [Polygons](https://frbcesab.github.io/spatial-r/chapters/13_polygons.html): Complete with land cover information as spatial polygons.  

**Half day 2: Rasters**    
- [raster](https://frbcesab.github.io/spatial-r/chapters/13_polygons.html): Discover what is a raster and get the elevation profile from field observation 
- [multi layer](https://frbcesab.github.io/spatial-r/chapters/22_multilayer.html): Trace back montly climate information at the field sites. 
 

### Other tutorials

- [Toydata](https://frbcesab.github.io/spatial-r/chapters/31_toydata_mpl.html): how to get data from GBIF, IGN and CHELSA to create a toy dataset for the workshop?

**To be created**:  
- mapview
- mapsf
- tmap
- tutoE1 : POLYGON: calculate convex hull, simplify geometries, aggregate, union, etc... spatial influence  
- tutoE2 : get data from WMS or WFS  
- tutoE3 : spatial autocorrelation - how to measure it, what to do about it? spatial regression model, local regression  
- tutoE4 : Krigging and interpolation  
- tutoE5 : remote sensing, landsat and modis  
- tutoE6 : GoogleEarthEngine, what it is and how to use it (mostly out of R)
