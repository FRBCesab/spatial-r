# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is a collection of tutorials on how to handle spatial data in R.

It is made for a two half-day workshop, but you can follow the tutorials on your own pace.

The aims of this workshop is to :  

> Feel more comfortable to work with spatial data   
> Load spatial data in R and visualize it   
> Extract information from remote sensing or other fields  
> Take advantage of the numerous databases that are available online   


The tutorial targets students and scientists in ecology with previous knowledge of the [R software](https://cran.r-project.org/).

#### R package

The tutorials will mostly rely on (terra R-package)[] for most of the spatial data handling.  
R is exceptional due to its diversity, and their exist other package to handle spatial data, sf and stars being also very good resources.  

#### Key resources

These tutorials has been inspired by brilliant resources online:   

- Hijman R. et al. [Spatial Data Science with R and “terra”](https://rspatial.org/)   
- Pebesma and Bivand [Spatial Data Science: With Applications in R](https://r-spatial.org/book/)
- Moraga P. (2023)[Spatial Statistics for Data Science: Theory and Practice with R](https://www.paulamoraga.com/book-spatial/)


#### Preliminary program

**Day 1**  
- lesson1 : INTRODUCTION GIS, vector vs raster view, projection system (CRS)   
- tuto1 : VECTOR: create points and polygons; map and project spatial objects, calculate distance and areas   
- tuto2 : RASTER: load and download rasters, change their resolutions, map etc   
- tuto3 : EXTRACT: how to mix them: raster and points, raster and buffer, raster and polygons, projection raster>polygon  

**Day 2**  
- lesson2 : INTRODUCTION GIS, vector vs raster view, projection system (CRS)     
- tuto4 : STACK: how to load and manipulate multilayer rasters (e.g. remote sensing), thresholding multi day, and multi spectral   
- tuto5 : COMBINE MULTI-SOURCE DATA - reprojecting rasters, tips and tricks    
- tuto6 : INTERACTIVE maps with leaflet, mapview, or tmap   


**Extra**:  
- tutoE1 : POLYGON: calculate convex hull, simplify geometries, aggregate, union, etc... spatial influence  
- tutoE2 : get data from WMS or WFS  
- tutoE3 : spatial autocorrelation - how to measure it, what to do about it? spatial regression model, local regression  
- tutoE4 : Krigging and interpolation  
- tutoE5 : remote sensing, landsat and modis  
- tutoE6 : GoogleEarthEngine, what it is and how to use it (mostly out of R)
