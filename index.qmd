# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is a collection of tutorials on how to handle spatial data in R.

It is made for a two half-day workshop, but you can follow the tutorials on your own pace.

The aims of this workshop is to :  

> Feel more comfortable to work with spatial data   
> Load spatial data in R and visualize it   
> Extract information from remote sensing or other fields  
> Take advantage of the numerous databases that are available online   


The tutorial targets students and scientists in ecology with previous knowledge of the [R software](https://cran.r-project.org/).

#### R package

The tutorials will mostly rely on (terra R-package)[] for most of the spatial data handling.  
R is exceptional due to its diversity, and their exist other package to handle spatial data, sf and stars being also very good resources.  

#### Key resources

These tutorials has been inspired by brilliant resources online:   

- Hijman R. et al. [Spatial Data Science with R and “terra”](https://rspatial.org/)   
- Pebesma and Bivand [Spatial Data Science: With Applications in R](https://r-spatial.org/book/)
- Moraga P. (2023)[Spatial Statistics for Data Science: Theory and Practice with R](https://www.paulamoraga.com/book-spatial/)
