    "text": "Preface\nThis is a collection of tutorials on how to handle spatial data in R.\nIt is made for a two half-day workshop, but you can follow the tutorials on your own pace.\nThe aims of this workshop is to :\n\nFeel more comfortable to work with spatial data\nLoad spatial data in R and visualize it\nExtract information from remote sensing or other fields\nTake advantage of the numerous databases that are available online\n\nThe tutorial targets students and scientists in ecology with previous knowledge of the R software.\n\nR package\nThe tutorials will mostly rely on (terra R-package)[] for most of the spatial data handling.\nR is exceptional due to its diversity, and their exist other package to handle spatial data, sf and stars being also very good resources.\n\n\nKey resources\nThese tutorials has been inspired by brilliant resources online:\n\nHijman R. et al. Spatial Data Science with R and “terra”\n\nPebesma and Bivand Spatial Data Science: With Applications in R\nMoraga P. (2023)Spatial Statistics for Data Science: Theory and Practice with R\n\n\n\nPreliminary program\nDay 1\n- lesson1 : INTRODUCTION GIS, vector vs raster view, projection system (CRS)\n- tuto1 : VECTOR: create points and polygons; map and project spatial objects, calculate distance and areas\n- tuto2 : RASTER: load and download rasters, change their resolutions, map etc\n- tuto3 : EXTRACT: how to mix them: raster and points, raster and buffer, raster and polygons, projection raster&gt;polygon\nDay 2\n- lesson2 : INTRODUCTION GIS, vector vs raster view, projection system (CRS)\n- tuto4 : STACK: how to load and manipulate multilayer rasters (e.g. remote sensing), thresholding multi day, and multi spectral\n- tuto5 : COMBINE MULTI-SOURCE DATA - reprojecting rasters, tips and tricks\n- tuto6 : INTERACTIVE maps with leaflet, mapview, or tmap\nExtra:\n- tutoE1 : POLYGON: calculate convex hull, simplify geometries, aggregate, union, etc… spatial influence\n- tutoE2 : get data from WMS or WFS\n- tutoE3 : spatial autocorrelation - how to measure it, what to do about it? spatial regression model, local regression\n- tutoE4 : Krigging and interpolation\n- tutoE5 : remote sensing, landsat and modis\n- tutoE6 : GoogleEarthEngine, what it is and how to use it (mostly out of R)",
